# Jack Black Attack

JBA is a Rouguelike MVP created for the CPP Game Development Club pitch in Fall of 2023 by a 10 person team. I was the team lead for the project, was the main game designer, and worked on setting up the backend gameplay systems.

## Contributions

#### Team Lead

This was my first experience acting as a team lead for a long term project with so many people. Due to working within the club, I had to present my game pitch, prepare for team checkins, as well as managing tasks and meetings for team members.

I used a variety of softwares to manage the team:
* Trello - Task creation and management
* Milanote - Flowcharts and moodboards
* Discord - Communication

#### Game Designer

The idea for this game was inspired by a GDC talk where the speaker suggested constraints for creative freedom, and mentioned cards. I decided to take that into the idea of having a randomly generated dungeon based on blackjack, where the card would determine where enemies spawned.

#### Level Designer
Naturally to finish the game we actually needed to have playable levels, and since I created the navigation system I also took on the responsibility of making two of the levels. In order to make the game longer I designed the levels to be large and challenging so that players would have to learn each mechanic in order to beat our game.
* Level 2 - A very linear map with several sections, each having multiple viable pathways through. Frequent hiding spots to take a rest, as well as a large number of collectable bees to survive the many bear attacks.
* Level 3 - A much larger map, with different pathways, but only one path to the finish. Items were spread throughout the map, in smaller quantities as the bears were more spread out as well. Despite many of the patrol paths being relatively small, one group of bears have a path that traverse the entire level, encouraging the player to keep moving in case of an unexpected bear walking through.

## What I Learned

Although this project reached the standard the club was looking for, and we completed all of the core MVP tasks, I still think I made a lot of mistakes that I will learn from in the future. These mostly relate to the team management skills that I had yet to develop before this project
