## Gameplay

Play as a rat in the sewers of Victorian London to become an honorable rat
Attack with your pen as a melee weapon
Once you have slain enough enemies use their blood to fuel your ranged attack


## Contributions

I took a small part on a large team, so I just created a few enemies to fulfill the generic enemy types
A ranged enemy that keeps it's distance, a tank enemy with powerful attacks, and a fast stealth enemy that chases you anywhere

## What did I learn

I really enjoyed working on this project as a secondary game to work on at the time. I had no part in the leadership, and was given freedom to grab tasks for myself each week, and implement them to the best of my ability. It was a very relaxing project to be able to let go of game design, and taught me that I can be happy in a project without having a high degree of control over other members and the final outcome.

It also taught me how to work within the scope of other people's work a lot more than other projects. I learned to be a lot more careful in Git, especially within the context of Unity. Also implementing clean code principles and being very intentional with all of my work, and making it as easy to modify in Unity's inspector as possible.
