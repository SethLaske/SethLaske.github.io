## Gameplay

Play as a rat in the sewers of Victorian London to become an honorable rat
Attack with your pen as a melee weapon
Once you have slain enough enemies use their blood to fuel your ranged attack


## Contributions

I took a small part on a large team, so I just created a few enemies to fulfill the generic enemy types
A ranged enemy that keeps it's distance, a tank enemy with powerful attacks, and a fast stealth enemy that chases you anywhere

## What did I learn

I really enjoyed this project, as I could be given tasks, and just finish them. I enjoy designing games, but working on this project showed me that I can appreciate stepping back and just finishing all of my assigned tasks for a game
