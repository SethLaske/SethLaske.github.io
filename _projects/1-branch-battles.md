## Gameplay

Train miners to get gold, use gold to get soldiers, use soldiers to get victory.
Play 15 unique levels
Unlock 8 different units
Battle in 4 different combat styles
Only 1 chance for glory


## Why

I created this game as a tribute to one of my childhood favorites, **Stick War**
It was a complex enough game that I knew I could learn a lot, but fundamentally simple enough to be able to complete in a reasonable amount of time
I wanted to be able to completely solo a game, and so everything was created entirely by me (except sound)


## The Good

Despite this being my first time working through an entire project on my own I don't feel that I was ever completely stalled
There were periods of time that I couldn't work on it as much, but throughout the year I was consistently working on it
I am especially proud that it is a game, with a start middle and end, that I created and anyone can play
Some specific elements that I am really happy about:
* Troop Movements- Units space themselves out organically, follow behind specific troops, and form patterns very cleanly regardless of army composition and position
* Save System- Although not a specifically challenging feature to implement, there were nuances to it that I couldn't have appreciated without working on myself and it is key to making this feel like a more professional game
* Player Engagement- Not everyone I've sent the game out to has been really impressed with the copy and geniunely seem to enjoy playing the game
* Artwork- I'm not artist by any means, but compared to the art I produced at the beginning, the released game has its own style and the animations flow
* Depth of gameplay- Perhaps a con to some people, but the levels are challenging enough and the player is given enough different options that it truely is a strategy game that forces players to adapt 

## The Bad

Even though Branch Battles is released, there are still plenty of issues to address, and some weaknesses in the foundations of the game that I should address
* Dirty Code- My coding ability throughout has been improving, which revealed a lot of inconsistencies and inefficiencies in my early code that is painful to look back on
* Artwork- Due to it not being my focus for the game, and not an aspect I enjoy working on, there are a lot of animations I never added, and the menus look dreadful compared to the art in each level
* Level Balancing- Lack of indepth outside playtesters allowed me to make certain levels very challenging for myself... and downright unfair for other players

## Whats Next?

The game may be released, but there is plenty for me to still add when I find the time
* Sound Controls
* Level Balancing/Difficulty Options
* Better UI Art
* Mini Map
* Multiple Save Files
* And Way Too Much More

## Progression

Might talk about the journey along the way... But the rest of this website ain't gonna finish itself
