# **About Me**

Hi I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** ,<br>
I'm a graduating CS major from Cal Poly Pomona, looking to get into the video game industry as a **Gameplay/AI Programmer**.
During my time at CPP I have grown my passion from playing video games to making them, leading me to take every game related course my major has to offer, and taking additional math courses. I love the problem solving and the infinite amount of polish that games require, leading me to work on several by myself or in teams.

I am a huge fan of working on projects that I can see the results in real time and visually debug as I work. That in combination with my personal love for video games growing up is what lead me to want to work on games as a professional, a decision I have been increasingly confident in as I have worked on these games. Especially the AI and mechanics within games, as that is where I have the most fun and am able to spend more time trying to perfect the features I try to create. I do also enjoy the creative freedom of game design, in being able to determine what I believe will improve the game.

When I'm not working on schoolwork or making video games I spend my time 
* Playing games (Favorites include JRPGs and Strategy games)
* Running (Always training for the sub 15 minute 3 mile)
* Rock climbing (A very impressive V4 max boulder, 5.11B/C max top rope)
* Reading (Typically fantasy, but I need to finish my Corvette book)
* Hanging out with friends (Spikeball, Blackjack, Swimming, etc)
