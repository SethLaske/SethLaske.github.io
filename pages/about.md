# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** ,<br>
I'm a graduating CS major from Cal Poly Pomona, looking to get into the video game industry when I graduate as a **Gameplay/AI Programmer**
I have been working on a variety of smaller projects during my education, take a look at my projects to see more details

When I'm not working on schoolwork or making video games I spend my time playing games, running, rock climbing, reading, and hanging out with friends
